**Note :** If you confront any problem with SimpleTimer library, kindly download this version from my fork
https://github.com/wbadry/SimpleTimer

Install it using "**Add .zip library**" in include library option. Restart **Arduino IDE** and code will be compiled.
 

# 10-October-2016
**Lab 1** was added with Proteus, LabVIEW and Arduino files for reading 2 channels  magnetic encoder.

**Lab1 Highlights**

 1. Importance of understanding encoders in mechatronic systems.
 2. Types of encoders.
 3. Designing of an LCD based encoder reading with casual connection to NI LabVIEW.
